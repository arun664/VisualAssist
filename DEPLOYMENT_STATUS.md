# Deployment Configuration Summary

## ✅ Current Deployment Setup (Railway Only)

This project has been configured for **Railway-only deployment** to simplify the deployment process and reduce maintenance overhead.

### Active Deployment Services

#### 🚂 Railway (Primary Backend)
- **Purpose**: AI Navigation Assistant backend with FastAPI + YOLOv11
- **Configuration**: `railway.json`, root `Dockerfile`  
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml`
- **URL Format**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Automatic Docker deployment
  - ✅ Health check monitoring (`/health` endpoint)
  - ✅ Environment variable management
  - ✅ Auto-scaling and 24/7 availability
  - ✅ Integrated with GitHub Actions

#### 📄 GitHub Pages (Frontend)
- **Purpose**: Static frontend and client interfaces
- **Configuration**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **URLs**: 
  - Frontend: `https://arun664.github.io/VisualAssist/`
  - Client: `https://arun664.github.io/VisualAssist/client/`
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Free static hosting
  - ✅ Automatic HTTPS
  - ✅ Connected to Railway backend via CORS

## 🗑️ Removed Deployment Options

The following deployment platforms were **removed** to streamline the project:

### ❌ Fly.io
- **Removed**: GitHub Actions workflow configurations
- **Reason**: Redundant with Railway, Railway provides better AI/ML support
- **Files Cleaned**: 
  - Removed Fly deployment job from `deploy-backend.yml`
  - No `fly.toml` configuration files were present

### ❌ Render.com  
- **Removed**: GitHub Actions workflow configurations
- **Reason**: Railway offers better Docker support and easier setup
- **Files Cleaned**: 
  - Removed Render deployment job from `deploy-backend.yml`
  - No Render-specific configuration files were present

### ❌ Duplicate GitHub Container Registry
- **Removed**: `deploy-backend.yml` workflow (redundant)
- **Reason**: Railway deployment workflow is more comprehensive
- **Kept**: `railway-deploy.yml` as the primary deployment workflow

## 📋 Files Modified

### Removed Files
- `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml` - Removed entirely (replaced by railway-deploy.yml)

### Updated Files
- `RAILWAY_SETUP.md` - Updated to reflect Railway-only deployment
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Created this summary document

### Preserved Files
- `.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml` - Primary deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Pages deployment (frontend/client)
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Railway-optimized Docker configuration  
- `config.js` - Already configured for Railway backend URLs
